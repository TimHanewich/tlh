            <p class="content-desc">I offer customers an Eight Step Service Program.  Many outdoor lighting systems are sold as being maintenance-free, but this is simply not true.  Virtually anything you buy, especially something you put outside, needs some level of maintenance.  Having a service plan is the only way to completely protect your investment.  While there may be no bulbs to change, there is still cleaning, adjusting, and core system checks that need to be performed.  This Seven Step Service Program is designed to keep those lights glowing without interruption. The seven steps include:</p>
            <ol class="content-desc">
                <li>Cleaning of all fixtures and checking of water-proof drum connectors</li>
                <li>Cleaning each fixture lense to ensure optimal light output</li>
                <li>Apply <b>Dielectric Grease</b> to bulb connections and o-rings to prevent corrosion and allow ease of access to the fixture</li>
                <li>Minor adjustment of light fixtures for refocusing</li>
                <li>Minor trimming/pruning around fixtures</li>
                <li>Reburying of  any exposed wire</li>
                <li>Check transformers.  Ensure proper input and output voltages, and that terminal connections are properly secured.</li>
                <li>Check timer settings and operation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="content-desc" style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">The maintenance cost is determined by the number of installed fixtures on your property.</p>
